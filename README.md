# Toshi Turtled App

This is currently little more than a chatbot. A very bad chatbot at that.

## Vision
What I am working towards is a bot that will help you with your Coinbase transactions by notifying you when prices hit a certain threshold (high for selling and low for buying).

The bot should also give you the ability to check your Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin wallets and allow you to move those coins around.

I first plan to implement this using API keys, but I later hope to implement OAuth2. First thing first, I need to get the Coinbase API to work properly. 

Todo:
[x] Setup Coinbase API
[x] Create way for users to add own Coinbase API
[x] Show users their balances in their Coinbase accounts
[] Show balances in USD
[] Create menu item to select a specific account/wallet
[] Implement OAuth2
